pitch: "OWASP Trainings are highly sought, industry-respected, educational, career advancing, and fun. In March 2021 the OWASP Foundation is bringing the global AppSec community a fresh set of Virtual Training offerings with the launch of our year long program. 

<br><br>Join us throughout 2021 as we offer new topics and skills through our OWASP Virtual Training Course line-up which kicks off with new offerings this March. We'll be crossing multiple timezones, so be sure not miss out on these back-to-back multi-day virtual trainings to retool and level-up.
<br><br>Virtual Trainings will be offered in a multi-day format, with two days of programming in 4 hour blocks each day."
