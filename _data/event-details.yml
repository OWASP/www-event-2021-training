pitch: "OWASP Top 10 Developer Training
<br>
<br>
NOTE: This is ONE training course that is being split over the course of TWO days, FOUR hours each day. Wednesday, December 15, AND Friday, December 17. Friday will be a continuation from Wednesday. Both training days will begin at 7 am/PST.
<br>
Software developers are the foundation of any application. As software developers author code that makes up a web application or API, they need to embrace and practice a wide variety of secure coding techniques. The OWASP Top Ten (2021) is an OWASP documentation project that lists critical security risks that should be addressed in every software development project. This document was written to assist those new to secure development.
<br>
This training is targeted for developers to help them write more secure code. This class will include both lectures and a variety of demonstrations. We'll also do a few different labs together at the end of the class on day 2.
<br>
We will cover the following topics:
<br>
A01:2021-Broken Access Control
<br>
A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures
<br>
A03:2021-Injection
<br>
