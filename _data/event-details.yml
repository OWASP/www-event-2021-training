    ### Train with OWASP Training. 

    OWASP Trainings are highly sought, industry-respected, educational, career advancing, and fun. In December 2021 the OWASP Foundation is bringing the global AppSec community a special holiday offering. 
    <br><br>Join us throughout 2022 as we offer all new topics and skills through our OWASP Virtual Training Course line-up. We'll be crossing multiple timezones, so be sure not miss out on these multi-day virtual trainings to retool and level-up.
    <br><br>Additional program details, timezones, and information will be available here and on the training sites of the various events.
